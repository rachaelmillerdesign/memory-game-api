Chambered Nautilus,Nautilus Pompilius,"Nautiluses first appeared about 500 million years ago during the Cambrian Explosion—they were jet-propelling themselves through ancient seas 265 million years before dinosaurs inhabited the Earth! (and 200 million years longer than the horseshoe crab!) The Nautilus lives in tropical waters. Up to 10.5 inches in diameter, this cephalopod can live 15 or more years.  Nautilus are prized for the beautiful perfectly logarithmic mother of pearl spiral visible when sliced in cross section. Recently scientists have become alarmed at declining populations of nautilus resulting from overfishing, and are studying world populations to determine the need for protection under the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species",unknown,Tropical waters world wide. ,https://i.imgur.com/uBYlAqg.jpg
MALAGASY RAINBOW FROG,raochestes resplendens,"I am found in dry rocky forests in Madagascar.  I am 1-1.5” long and very brightly colored.  I am adapted for both underground and climbing lifestyles.  I have  horny tubercles on the underside of my hind feet to help with burrowing, and  also claws on my forefeet which allow me to cling to canyon walls to escape floods or predators! I can survive underground for up to 10 months living on insects. If threatened, I can inflate myself in defense.  Habitat loss and being over collected for the pet trade threaten my survival in the wild.",Endangered,Madagascar,https://i.imgur.com/lmnB73h.jpg
VICTORIA CROWNED PIGEON,Goura victoria,"I am the largest pigeon species in the world!  At about 29” long and over 5 pounds in weight, I am enormous if compared to Domestic Pigeons (about 12-13” in length and weighing less than one pound). In the day I forage with my flock on the ground for fruits, seeds, and snails. At night we sleep in the trees.  Due to ongoing habitat loss and being quite tame and therefore easily hunted.",Vulnerable,"New Guinea, Indonesia",https://i.imgur.com/75z97bA.jpg
LILAC BREASTED ROLLERBIRD,Coracias caudatus,"I live throughout sub-saharan Africa  in both woodland and savannas.  I perch at the tops of trees or poles looking for prey on the ground including insects, scorpions, snails, frogs, small snakes, lizards and rodents. I resemble a crow in size and build - but not in color! I get my name from the impressive aerial acrobatics I perform as part of courtship.",,,https://i.imgur.com/7VCFbW7.jpg
SULKOWSKI’S MORPHO,morpho meneleus,"Is it a bird? Is it a plane?? No, it is a brilliant swarm of irridescent Blue Morpho butterflies! We range in size from 3-8 inches.  Throughout our life cycle our home is the tropical forests of Latin America from Mexico to Colombia.  Like all butterflies we taste with our feet and taste/smell the air with our antennae.  Populations of Blue morphos are severely threatened by deforestation of tropical forests and habitat fragmentation. ",,,https://i.imgur.com/ipHDDEb.jpg
GOLDEN SNUB-NOSE MONKEY,Rhinopithecus roxellana,"High in the mountainous Qin Ling forests of central China we live in large groups of up to 600 members.  Over 90% of our lives is spent in the trees where we eat lichens, tree needles, bamboo buds, fruits, and leaves.  We range in size from 20-32” (not including our tails).  Due to habitat loss and hunting we are listed  by the IUCN Red List as Endangered.",,,https://i.imgur.com/fdviBA1.jpg
FAIRY PITTA,Pitta nympha,"I live in dense moist forests in Japan, South Korea, China, and Taiwan.  I am a brilliantly colored bird about 7.5” in body length.  I  am rather shy.  I spend a lot of my time in the leaf litter hunting for invertebrates of all sorts (spiders, insects, snails, earthworms, etc.).  Once found abundantly, I am now classified as vulnerable by BirdLife International due to habitat loss and the pet trade.",,,https://i.imgur.com/hZqI33E.jpg
JACKSON’S CHAMELEON,chamaeleo jacksonii,"I am native to the humid cooler regions of Kenya and Tanzania.  Like all chameleons I can move my eyes independently of each other and like most I can change my color. I spend my time in trees where I get I good grip with my unusual tongs-like feet and my Prehensile tail. I can shoot out my tongue (longer than my body when fully extended!) to catch prey on its sticky end faster than human eyes can follow (about 30 thousandths of a second).  Mostly I eat insects, spiders, and scorpions.  I grow to be about 12” long.",,,https://i.imgur.com/8ukTHCc.jpg
MADAGASCAN MANTELLA,Mantella madagascariensis,"Madagascar, 250 miles off the east coast of Africa, is home to many amazing animals and plants which are found nowhere else in the world. This includes the entire genus of Mantella frogs.  These tiny (up to 2”) frogs wear their various bright colors to let predators know they are toxic.  Unlike most frogs, Mantellas do not have webbed feet, perfect for them as they spend most of their time crawling or climbing on land.  Of the 16 Mantella species 11 are either at critical risk, endangered, or vulnerable. Threats to these delicate frogs include habitat loss, contaminants, introduced species, global climate change, and the pet trade.",,,https://i.imgur.com/eLf582x.jpg
MANDARINFISH,Synchiropus splendiduS,"I may be small, but I am brilliant!  I do not have scales for protection as most fish do- instead I have a thick protective coat of bitter tasting mucus. I am native to the Pacific ocean ranging from Ryukyu Island to Australia.  I prefer shallow reefs where I live in areas covered with branching corals and encrusted rock. I am about 2.5” long.  I am quite shy.  My beautiful colors make me a popular aquarium fish species.  Every year more than 3 to 4 million fish of all types are removed from the wild for sale to the aquarium trade.",,,https://i.imgur.com/xY36bE9.jpg
GULPER EEL,eurapharynx pelecanoides,"71% of Earth’s surface is ocean!  If you rotate a globe so that Africa is on the far side you may be surprised to see little land in sight.  Deep below the ocean surface is a mysterious world that takes up 95% of Earth’s living space. There, often in complete darkness, or without oxygen, or in highly saline water that may be as hot as 300 °F, live a vast array of lifeforms!  We know very little about most of the creatures who spend their lives in this ‘abyss’",,,https://i.imgur.com/4rg8q2l.jpg

PURPLE SPOTTED SWALLOWTAIL,graphium weiskii,"New Guinea is home to spectacular butterfly fauna including the world’s largest butterfly, the Queen Alexandra’s Birdwing, whose wingspan can be up to 12.2 inches! Thankfully, it is also home to The Insect Farming and Trading Agency (IFTA) which has been in operation in Papua New Guinea since 1978.  By turning Birdwings, Purple Spotted Swallowtails, and other insects into a cash crop villagers are both earning money and practicing sound wildlife conservation.",,,https://i.imgur.com/y8g7TgW.jpg

SHOEBILL STORK,Balaeniceps rex,"Look me in the eyes: I stand an impressive 54” tall, often still as a statue, and am not afraid to stare  right back at you!  I live in East Central Africa where I forage along the marshy banks of papyrus swamps for lungfish, frogs, and small crocodiles.  I am usually silent but sometimes will participate in bill clattering.  I share characteristics with storks, herons, and pelicans but I am evolutionarily unique and am  the only species in my family.  Due to habitat loss and hunting the population of Shoebills is declining.",Vulnerable,,https://i.imgur.com/0xsk0cg.jpg
